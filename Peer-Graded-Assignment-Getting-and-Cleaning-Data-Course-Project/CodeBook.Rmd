# R script Description

The **run_analysis.R** script prepares the data and executes the following 5 steps required as stated in the course projectâ€™s definition:

 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 Using the rbind() function, the train data sets will be summarized in a new one.
 This also applies to the train and test data sets using the same function,  
 After binding and obtaining the required data sets, we will use the Merge function to obtain the final version of the combined datasets.
 
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for        each measurement.
 The final data set obtained in 1. will be used to extract  specific columns using chaining and functions such as select()
 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 In the obtained tidy dataset in 2., values in the code column, will be replaced by values from the activities variable.
 
 4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 In this step of the code, we will modify the column names with ones that we will specify. This can be repeatedly done using gsub() function
 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set     with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject     
This step summarizes the tiny dataset in a second one on which we used the aggregate function. The new dataset will finally be transmitted and written in a table.

# Used variables

* **x_train, y_train, subject_train,x_test, y_test and subject_test** describe the data from the downloaded files in txt format.
* **x_data, y_data and subject_data** merge the described data sets above.
* **features** describes the correct names for the x_data dataset, these names are related to the column names.
